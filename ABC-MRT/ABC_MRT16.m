function [phi_hat,success]= ABC_MRT16(speech_path,cond_num,n_files,verbose)
%--------------------------Background--------------------------
%ABC_MRT16.m implements the ABC-MRT16 algorithm for objective estimation of 
%speech intelligibility.  The algorithm is discussed in detail in [1] and
%[2].
%
%The Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) is a protocol for evaluating speech
%intelligibility using human subjects [3]. The subjects are presented
%with the task of identifying one of six different words that take the
%phonetic form CVC.  The six options differ only in the leading or
%trailing consonant. MRT results take the form of success rates
%(corrected for guessing) that range from 0 (guessing) to 1 
%(correct identification in every case).  These success rates form a 
%measure of speech intelligibility in this specific (MRT) context.
%
%The 2016 version of Articulation Band Correlation-MRT, (ABC-MRT16) is a 
%signal processing algorithm that processes MRT audio files and produces
%success rates.
%
%The goal of ABC-MRT16 is to produce success rates that agree with those
%produced by MRT. Thus ABC-MRT16 is an automated or objective version of
%MRT and no human subjects are required. ABC-MRT16 uses a very simple and
%specialized speech recognition algorithm to decide which word was spoken.
%This version has been tested on narrowband, wideband, superwideband,
%and fullband speech.
%
%Information on preparing test files and running ABC_MRT16.m can be found
%in the readme file included in the distribution.  ABC_MRTdemo16.m shows
%example use.
%
%--------------------------Use--------------------------
%[phi_hat,success]=ABC_MRT16(speech_path,cond_num,n_files,verbose)
%
% - speech_path is a string that gives the path to the speech files
%
% - cond_num is the condition number, 0 to 99. This is used to form the
%   end of the path and the filenames as specified below.
%
% - n_files is the number of speech files to use, 16 <= N <= 1200.
%   Using more speech files gives a more robust result, but takes longer.
%   One can use filelist.m to generate the list of .wav files required
%   for any valid values of n_files and cond_num.
%
% - verbose is set to any nonzero value to force progress reporting
%
% - success is a column vector with length n_files that gives the success
%   rate for each file involved in the test. The entries in success are
%   the success flags c_j defined in equation (8) in [1].
%
% - phi_hat is a scalar that gives the final intelligibility estimate for
%   the condition.  It is defined in equation (10) of [1], using the values
%   of alpha and beta given in the final full paragraph on page 3 of [1].
%   phi_hat is produced from success by averaging over all files, correcting
%   for guessing and applying an affine transformation.  phi_hat is
%   expected to range from 0 to 1, similar to MRT results. Larger values
%   of phi_hat indicate higher levels of speech intelligibility
%
%--------------------------File Convention--------------------------
%Note that ABC_MRT16.m is expecting a specific naming convention. Here are
%some examples:
%
%ABC_MRT16(e:/soundfiles/MRT/,1,1200,*), requires 1200 .wav
%files of the form e:/soundfiles/MRT/C01/TT_bnn_wm_c01.wav
%
%ABC_MRT16(e:/soundfiles/MRT/,17,16,*), requires 16 .wav
%files of the form e:/soundfiles/MRT/C17/TT_bnn_wm_c17.wav
%
%In every case the base of the filenames takes the form TT_bnn_wm with:
%   TT=F1,F3, M3, or M4 (talker specification)
%   nn=1 to 50 (list specification)
%   m=1 to 6 (word specification)
%(Note that 4 x 50 x 6 =1200, so these ranges allow specification of all
%1200 files)
